description: Diamond is the motherless son of a poor coachman. He is awakened one
  night by the rushing of the North Wind. A voie calls to him from outside and the
  wind is revealed as a beautiful woman, who takes Diamond in her arms and introduces
  him to many adventures. She carries him to the land "at the back of the North Wind"
  which, far from being a frozen, polar region, is one of beautiful pastures, streams
  and happiness.
